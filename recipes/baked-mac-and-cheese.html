        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cup half and half</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cup shredded Colby Jack cheese</li>
        <li>2 cup gruyere</li>
        <li>1/2 cup smoked gouda</li>
        <li>1/2 tbsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tsp paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp nutmeg</li>
        <li>2 tsp italian seasoning</li>
        <li>A dash of tumeric</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic</li>
     </ul>

     <h3><u>Steps</u></h3>
     <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 325 F and grease a 9x13" baking dish. Set aside</li>
        <li>In a large saucepan, melt butter with fresh garlic (minced). Simmer on 
            low heat until garlic is fragrant.  Turn off heat and let garlic
            infuse for at least 20 min.
        </li>
        <li>Shred all the cheeses and mix together in a bowl.  Set aside</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Add 
            elbow macaroni and cook 1 minute less than al dente according to
            the package instructions (This is to make sure that we don't end
            up with mushy mac and cheese after baking). Strain macaroni and 
            add in a pat of butter to prevent sticking.
        </li>
        <li>Strain the garlic from butter and set aside. Put butter back in
            saucepan </li>
        <li>Over medium heat, sprinkle in flour and whisk to combine until 
            mixture looks like very wet sand.  Cook for ~1 min while 
            constantly whisking.  When the roux looks golden brown, slowly
            pour in about 2 cups of the half and half, whisking constantly
            until smooth.  Slowly pour in the remaining half and half + the
            whole milk , while whisking constantly until smooth.
        </li>
        <li>Continue to heat over medium , whisking constantly still, until
            thickened to a very thick consistency.  Add in spices as well as
            the reserved garlic.
        </li>
        <li>Remove from heat and stir in 3 cups of the cheese until smooth.
            Add in cheese in small batches to prevent clumnps
        </li>
        <li>Combine cheese sauce with the cooked macaroni pasta.  Pour half 
            of the macaroni mixture into the greased baking pan and layer 
            with cheese. Pour the rest of the pasta mixture and top with
            remaining cheese.
        </li>
        <li>Bake for 15-20 min until the top cheese layer looks bubbly
            and light golden brown.
        </li>
        <li>Let cool down for at least 15 min, and serve warm!</li>
