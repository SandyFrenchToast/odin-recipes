    <h3><u>Steps</u></h3>


    <ol>
        <li>For rolls, Dissolve 1 packet of active dry yeast in 1 cup of lukewarm
            milk. Let sit for 10 min until the yeast bubbles up
        </li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the yeast mixture, 1/2 cup sugar, 
            6 tbsp melted butter, 1 tsp salt 2 eggs, and 4 cups of flour and mix
            until ragged dough forms</li>
        <li>If using a stand mixer, use dough hook and mix until a smooth, elastic
            dough forms.  If kneading by hand, turn dough onto a floured surface
            and knead for ~10-15 min until dough is slighlty tack and bounces back.
        </li>
        <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a clean towel, and let rise 
            in a warm place for about 1.5-2 hours, or until doubled in size./li>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix together 6 tbsp softened butter, 1 cup packed dark 
            brown sugar, and  3 tbsp cinnamon until well combined. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Once the dough has doubled in size, punch it down and roll it out on a 
            floured surface into a rectangle, about 16x20 inches. Spread the cinnamon 
            filling evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.
            Starting from the long edge, tightly roll up the dough into a log and cut
            into 12 equal sized pieces using a serrated knife or dental floss </li>
        <li>Place cinnamon buns into a greased baking dish, leaving space in between
            each one. Cover dish with a clean towel and let buns rise for another 35-40
            min in a warm place. While buns are proofing, preheat oven to 350 F
        </li>
        <li>Once buns have proof, bake for 25-30 minutes or until the tops look golden 
            brown.
        </li>
        <li>While the buns are baking, prepare the cream cheese frosting by beating together 
            1/4 cup softened cream cheese, 6 tbsp butter, 1/8 tsp salt, and 1/2 tsp vanilla 
            extract until smooth. Then, gradually add 1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar and beat
            until creamy and well combined.</li>
        <li>Once the cinnamon buns are done baking, remove them from the oven and let them 
            cool for a few minutes. Spread the cream cheese frosting evenly over the warm buns. </li>
        <li>Serve the cinnamon buns warm and enjoy!</li>
